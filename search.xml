    <content><![CDATA[<p>在给网站添加域名的映射时发现无法添加，显示已经存在同名称的A&#x2F;AAAA&#x2F;CNAME DNS记录，解决方法是删除DNS出售网站自带的域名映射。此外，在添加github的ipv4和ipv6地址映射后发现github无法识别到DNS记录（无法直接绑定apex domain），需要添加带www的域名后方可正常识别。这篇文章在总结问题的同时准备对多文字进行测试，并且尝试提供对于解决deploy更新内容不成功问题的思路。<img src="https://blogimages.floweronruins.com/i/2025/09/20/114cj-ch.png" alt="1743437549121.png"></p>

    <title>Deployment Related Issues</title>
    <url>/2025/09/20/Deployment-Related-Issues/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Eventually, two issues related to the deployment were solved. As it turns out, one should read the document more closely before taking any actions. The problem that the content would not update after deployment was because the public folder need to be deleted and the new version can be generated and uploaded, therefore “hexo cleaning” command have to be executed before deployment. As for the issue that DNS resolving was override everytime after deployment, that is solved by adding the CNAME file in the source folder. Both solution was found in <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages">https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages</a><br><img src="https://blogimages.floweronruins.com/i/2025/09/20/3aufo-yy.jpg" alt="微信图片_20240727101217.jpg"></p>

    <title>First post</title>
    <url>/2025/09/17/First-post/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post of this blog. Actually, I have already created a blog with the same method before but that was unusable due to inability to disengage the domain name I bought to the github site. Thank to the previous experience the installation of hexo this time is much easier and the only problem I encountered was the need for updating GIT and Node.js. I hope this new start also means a new start in my life,  a start of a phase with better attitudes and more concrete steps towards new goals.<img src="https://blogimages.floweronruins.com/i/2025/09/19/18u2st-tq.jpg" alt="屏幕截图 2024-08-22 112021.jpg"></p>
