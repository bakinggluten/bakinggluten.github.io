    <title>DNS Resolve</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>在给网站添加域名的映射时发现无法添加，显示已经存在同名称的A&#x2F;AAAA&#x2F;CNAME DNS记录，解决方法是删除DNS出售网站自带的域名映射。此外，在添加github的ipv4和ipv6地址映射后发现github无法识别到DNS记录（无法直接绑定apex domain），需要添加带www的域名后方可正常识别。这篇文章在总结问题的同时准备对多文字进行测试，并且尝试提供对于解决deploy更新内容不成功问题的思路。<img src="https://blogimages.floweronruins.com/i/2025/09/20/114cj-ch.png" alt="1743437549121.png"></p>

    <title>Comments system</title>
    <url>/2025/09/20/Comments-system/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>For the comment system for this blog, I tried multiple ways in enabling this function. Since this blog would post content in both English and Chinese, I would expect this comment system to be viable all over the world, therefore when I looked at the built-in comments systems, disquis and a few other options were ruled out as they are not usable in China. I first tried LiveRe and it turns out that it loads very slow in China. As for ChangYan, the aethetic design of the comment section is kind of old fashioned and (in my opinion) does not go well with the theme of this blog. Therefore I decide to go over some alternatives. The first came into my eyes is Waline. I have used Waline four years ago when I created my first blog and it worked out fine. However, the deployment method now uses Vercel which need to resolve my domain on Valine. However, as I am using cloudflare at the moment so this is not the best method for me. Eventually I found another popular comment system known as giscus, which rely on discuss section of github for the comments. Fortunately there is plugin for Next theme I am using (very appreciate the effort of developers) up to date (unlike many others which stop updating years ago), and this turns out to be both elegantly designed and I think, to be the most suitable comment system for my blog. Although github loading is not stable in China, comment section is easily loaded and even if people cannot log in their github account, they can still see other comments. Furthermore, it gives clear notice when people commented and is easy to manage with the comment section. For the anti-robot measures, I followed the instruction of the instructions on <a href="https://2x.nz/posts/giscus-akismet/">https://2x.nz/posts/giscus-akismet/</a> which reduces the chance of having advertisement robots posting comments in the comment section.<iframe src="//player.bilibili.com/player.html?isOutside=true&aid=114969412640531&bvid=BV1GTtgziEp9&cid=31478055153&p=1" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

    <title>First post</title>
    <url>/2025/09/17/First-post/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post of this blog. Actually, I have already created a blog with the same method before but that was unusable due to inability to disengage the domain name I bought to the github site. Thank to the previous experience the installation of hexo this time is much easier and the only problem I encountered was the need for updating GIT and Node.js. I hope this new start also means a new start in my life,  a start of a phase with better attitudes and more concrete steps towards new goals.<img src="https://blogimages.floweronruins.com/i/2025/09/19/18u2st-tq.jpg" alt="屏幕截图 2024-08-22 112021.jpg"></p>

    <title>Deployment Related Issues</title>
    <url>/2025/09/20/Deployment-Related-Issues/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Eventually, two issues related to the deployment were solved. As it turns out, one should read the document more carefully before taking any actions. The problem that the content would not update after deployment was because the public folder need to be deleted and the new version can be generated and uploaded, therefore “hexo cleaning” command have to be executed before deployment. As for the issue that DNS resolving was override everytime after deployment, that is solved by adding the CNAME file in the source folder. Both solution was found in <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages">https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages</a><br><img src="https://blogimages.floweronruins.com/i/2025/09/20/3aufo-yy.jpg" alt="微信图片_20240727101217.jpg"></p>
